You can't just stab the targets, it does not work. But, I lost my bow.
Ice pillars blocking the way. Maybe I could heat my sword up.
Just touching the tar can hurt. You have to throw something to hit the switches.
The light will kill them if I could just reflect it at them.
Down one hole, up a rope. It is so hard to get lost.
Dark and damp. How can souls survive down there.
Gusts of air, I just need to blow harder.
So high up. I wish it was not so high up.
Everything is so green. GREEEEEEENNNNN!
Welcome. Potion's 5 coins everything else 10. You touch it you buy it.
You have done it 100 souls. You now have a spot in the after life.

THANK YOU! I can move on now.   Goodbye.
